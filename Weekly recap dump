Last week, I identified that I was struggling with feeling overwhelmed and spoke with my mentor about it. Together, we worked out a plan of action so that I could always know what my next steps were, and set weekly learning goals so that I could feel like I had some sense of progress.
I started learning things on A Cloud Guru, which has been a great help. I learned about cloud computing and set up and SSH’d into an EC2 instance, and learned about AWS permissions and groups. I didn’t get everything I wanted done due to some issues with sleep, but I’m getting back on the horse this next week!

This week became a pretty big milestone for me. Finally, all these concepts started blending together enough to let me feel like I was finally understanding what I’m learning. On Friday, after I manually created a VPC, routing table, subnets, and NACLs in AWS, I realized confusion had given way to excitement! All those words I just typed, I UNDERSTAND THEM. They’re no longer just nebulous techy terms that I’m trying to glue into my brain. 
This is really big for several reasons, but the biggest is the dreaded cloud of imposter syndrome. I know it’s something everyone experiences, but for me it’s one of my bigger clouds. I didn’t plan on getting into tech. I’m just some girl from the boonies in Louisiana and I marvel every day at how far I’ve gotten in the tech world without a real plan or direction. I started at GoDaddy because it was a sales job, with no clue of just how many doors would open up as a result. I'm incredibly excited to start intentionally working towards specific goals, to keep furthering my knowledge. 
That said, let’s review this week because it was a really good one! 
I completed chapters 5-7 of the intro to AWS course on a cloud guru. This went over the most common file storage options available through AWS, and went into more detail on the benefits of using S3 and S3 glacier, as well as EFS, Amazon’s elastic filesystem storage. I set up a bucket in S3, added an object to it, enabled bucket versioning, made the bucket available to the public, and set the bucket policies to allow anonymous access to the bucket. Chapter 6 went over various database options, including RDS, DynamoDB, and Elasticache. In Chapter 7, I learned about some of the networking services AWS offers, touching on Route 53, VPC’s, and Cloudfront. I wrapped up this week in AWS content by completing a lab in which I manually created a VPC, created an Internet Gateway, edited the Main Route Table, created a NACL and associated it, and finally created two public subnets across two availability zones. 
My other focus this week was on Terraform (https://acloud.guru/overview/hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate-1) I completed chapter 3, which walked me through creating a t3.micro ec2 instance with AWS. The code for this can be found on https://github.com/tinadotmoardots/learning. I really enjoyed going through the manual settings with AWS first, because using terraform to do the same thing feels like magic, honestly. 
I ended up finishing everything I planned to do this week early, so I took some time to go through an additional course, https://learn.acloud.guru/course/admin-guide-to-bash-scripting. I finished up to Chapter 2 and completed the lab, which had me write a backup script to fulfill a hypothetical user request. I then SSH’d into a test server and ran the script to verify it worked as expected. This code was also uploaded to my github repository. 
I’ve also been taking the time to go through the GD Learn courses for hosting basics to refresh my memory of common hosting troubleshooting. I’m really glad I started doing this, because nothing boosts your confidence like reviewing basics! I’m also learning plenty of new things and filling in some gaps in my knowledge.
I think that’s it for this week! I feel really good about all of this. I feel like I’m making solid progress, and I’m feeling incredibly proud of myself for how far I’ve come.

This week my focus was more on Terraform and Linux. I worked on learning more about the Terraform state file and what it does. I also began working more with Terraform variables and outputs, and I'll be honest, things became a bit nebulous and foggy again. My plan for the next week is to spend some time re-reviewing the concepts on ACG before moving on. I'm also struggling with feeling confident enough in bash, so I'll be spending more time with that as well. My mentor made a study guide for me for my tech interview with Hashicorp, and I felt fairly confident about that as I completed it, but oof. I know what I know, and I know it well, but there's so much that I don't know. I wonder if I'll ever feel 100% confident in my knowledge? If I'm not, that's probably a good thing, right? That uncertainty is helping drive me to make sure I solidify these concepts and find ways to put them into practice. 
That said, my Terraform lab for the week was completing setup of an Apache Web Server on AWS. That was easy enough after the big youtube project! After that, the remaining Terraform stuff was learing about state storage and exploring state options with things like AWS S3, which tied into the AWS stuff I've been learing as well. 
For Linux this week, I worked a little bit with loops and substitutions and implemented some flow control into a backup script. I feel like I understand the most basic of things in bash, but I'm still in could pass a multiple choice test but fail if I was graded on writing and demoing my own scripts. 
I had my HTL interview this week! I'm not super confident on how that went, but every interview is an opportunity for practice. I let nerves get the best of me, which I wasn't expecting to happen. I did the best I could in the moment though, and that's all I can ask of myself. In the future I'll be sure to get some better interview prep in.

Code wars was rough. I'm at the point where I know what the legos are, and what they're used for, but I'm struggling with putting it into practice. I can follow a guide but not put things together in my own head very well. I feel like I tend to just look up how to do things and essentially just copy and paste what I find. I'd like to get to the point where I don't have to look up things. I'm guessing this is just a hump I'll have to brute force myself through. 

I figured out some Terraform stuff, like I said before, the wording on things seems to be what is making it rough on me. For example, in the lesson that modules were introduced, it was phrased, "a module is a container for multiple resources that can be used together." That made no sense to me and was just confusing. However, later on, it was phrased as, "Terraform modules are a good way to abstract out repeated chunks of code, making it reusable across other projects." That one made sense!

This week I honestly didn't get much done because of being down for the covid shot. 

What was your solution to the Codewars program, how would you optimize it? 
#!/bin/bash

countToTwenty() {
 echo "Count: "{1..20}
}

countToTwenty

However, I did end up looking this up. Idk if I'm putting too much pressure too soon on myself, but I don't like that I had to. I don't think I could optimize it any further?
What are three things learned from Linux Operating System Fundamentals?
I learned that Linux is FASCINATING OH MY. I learned about how OS's in general work, which was neat. I learned what a kernel is (a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system that has complete control over everything in the system).
