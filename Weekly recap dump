Last week, I identified that I was struggling with feeling overwhelmed and spoke with my mentor about it. Together, we worked out a plan of action so that I could always know what my next steps were, and set weekly learning goals so that I could feel like I had some sense of progress.
I started learning things on A Cloud Guru, which has been a great help. I learned about cloud computing and set up and SSH’d into an EC2 instance, and learned about AWS permissions and groups. I didn’t get everything I wanted done due to some issues with sleep, but I’m getting back on the horse this next week!

This week became a pretty big milestone for me. Finally, all these concepts started blending together enough to let me feel like I was finally understanding what I’m learning. On Friday, after I manually created a VPC, routing table, subnets, and NACLs in AWS, I realized confusion had given way to excitement! All those words I just typed, I UNDERSTAND THEM. They’re no longer just nebulous techy terms that I’m trying to glue into my brain. 
This is really big for several reasons, but the biggest is the dreaded cloud of imposter syndrome. I know it’s something everyone experiences, but for me it’s one of my bigger clouds. I didn’t plan on getting into tech. I’m just some girl from the boonies in Louisiana and I marvel every day at how far I’ve gotten in the tech world without a real plan or direction. I started at GoDaddy because it was a sales job, with no clue of just how many doors would open up as a result. I'm incredibly excited to start intentionally working towards specific goals, to keep furthering my knowledge. 
That said, let’s review this week because it was a really good one! 
I completed chapters 5-7 of the intro to AWS course on a cloud guru. This went over the most common file storage options available through AWS, and went into more detail on the benefits of using S3 and S3 glacier, as well as EFS, Amazon’s elastic filesystem storage. I set up a bucket in S3, added an object to it, enabled bucket versioning, made the bucket available to the public, and set the bucket policies to allow anonymous access to the bucket. Chapter 6 went over various database options, including RDS, DynamoDB, and Elasticache. In Chapter 7, I learned about some of the networking services AWS offers, touching on Route 53, VPC’s, and Cloudfront. I wrapped up this week in AWS content by completing a lab in which I manually created a VPC, created an Internet Gateway, edited the Main Route Table, created a NACL and associated it, and finally created two public subnets across two availability zones. 
My other focus this week was on Terraform (https://acloud.guru/overview/hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate-1) I completed chapter 3, which walked me through creating a t3.micro ec2 instance with AWS. The code for this can be found on https://github.com/tinadotmoardots/learning. I really enjoyed going through the manual settings with AWS first, because using terraform to do the same thing feels like magic, honestly. 
I ended up finishing everything I planned to do this week early, so I took some time to go through an additional course, https://learn.acloud.guru/course/admin-guide-to-bash-scripting. I finished up to Chapter 2 and completed the lab, which had me write a backup script to fulfill a hypothetical user request. I then SSH’d into a test server and ran the script to verify it worked as expected. This code was also uploaded to my github repository. 
I’ve also been taking the time to go through the GD Learn courses for hosting basics to refresh my memory of common hosting troubleshooting. I’m really glad I started doing this, because nothing boosts your confidence like reviewing basics! I’m also learning plenty of new things and filling in some gaps in my knowledge.
I think that’s it for this week! I feel really good about all of this. I feel like I’m making solid progress, and I’m feeling incredibly proud of myself for how far I’ve come.
